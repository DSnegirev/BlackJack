# BlackJack
A Text-Based Game of BlackJack. The user enters an amount of money to play with and makes bets every round until they either quit or run out of money. The user plays against the dealer, trying to get 21 or as close to 21 without going over. The dealer will also try to get 21 or close to 21 without going over.

I created the BlackJack class/main, using the Deck, Hand, Card and BlackJackHand class.
